                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>This text is supposed to be about me, but i don't really like sharing. So for the time being this is filler text</p>
                    <p>I also secretly Spider-Man, shouldn't really share that but who's really going to see this webpage. 
                        For those that see this, don't tell anyone</p>
                    <p>In my free time I play video games and watch some anime. My favorite video game franchise is Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy. My favorite anime is Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood</p>
                    <p>My favorite fun fact! So when the asteroid struck the Earth, it is in the realm of possiblity that the impact sent dinosaur bits into space. Thus its possible that there are dinosaur fossils on the moon.</p>
